1. A user creates an account - Need to add template for user profile, then a transition to in the save function to it. 
	once we have this we can add validators to the form fields.
	(what to do with email sent to user for verification?)

2. The user has a button on the home page saying "create my host profile" - May want to create checkbox on sign in to 
	indicate what they want to be; a wwoofer or host (or both). User profile page should indicate what account type they haveAdd conditional to profile template indicating create 
	host account. If clicked - the user is taken to the hosts/new route
3. After creating is profile, the user is taken to /host/{id}/edit to complete his profile (photos)
The user must have uploaded at least one photo before he can click "submit for validation"
The admin can then see the hosts waiting for validation and validate
